![Software Projects](https://github.com/wj01011/wj01011/blob/main/programming.png?raw=true)

I'm Wendy from Washington USA and I like to create software to help businesses run more efficiently. I'm currently
working on a webpage/mobile app that connects people to local eateries in the area. I enjoy learning new tools and programming languages and hope to become a full-stack developer.

In my spare time, I like to play with my cat Kimba and create Youtube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxHL8S7eFe8) for him. 

Skills: Python / Java / HTML / CSS / Javascript

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
