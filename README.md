### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS undergraduate from UW Seattle and I like to create software to help businesses run more efficiently. I'm currently
working on a webpage/mobile app that connects all foodie to local eateries in the area. I enjoy learning new tools 
and programming languages and hope to become a fullstack developer one day.

In my spare time, I like to play with my cat Kimba and create Youtube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxHL8S7eFe8) for him.
