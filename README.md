I'm Wendy from Washington USA and I like to create software to help businesses run more efficiently. I'm currently
working on a webpage/mobile app that connects people to local eateries in the area. 
I enjoy learning new tools and programming languages and hope to become a full-stack developer.

In my spare time, I like to play with my cat Kimba and create Youtube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxHL8S7eFe8) for him. 

Skills: Python / Java / HTML / CSS / Javascript

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
